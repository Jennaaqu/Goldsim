25/05 Model of Lysogeny
1. The model for lysogeny is the same as the lotka-volterra when probability of lysogeny P(L)=0.
2. If we go to the equilibrium (of Lotka-Volterra), we observe that the lysogeny model is also very unstable even when
the probability of lysogeny is P(L)=0.001. That's interesting
